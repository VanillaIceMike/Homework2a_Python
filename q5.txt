1) No it does not change the varaible a after the function call. The variable a remains the same value (32) after the
function is called. Since the variable a is passed by value it does not modify the passed variable and we are left
with just the original value of a.
2) Since the array being passed to the second function is defaulted to pass by refernce (based on element) then in our
increment function we are able to increment the first element in the array using the function.
3) They differ due to the way the two variables are passed. When b is set equal to the list ([32]) it is passing the whole array 
to the function which in retrospect is passing by reference. That is why it will alter the variable outside of the function.
However, a is one value that is being passed to the function as a value and therefore when the first incremenet
function is called it will not increment a at all.
